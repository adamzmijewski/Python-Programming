## List of tasks and high level modulesBased on your project design and prototype, make a list of the modules and tasks to do.

*  Connection

### Modules*  Login*  Create*  Edit / Delete*  Search### Tasks*  Design OOP Structural Model*  Test technologies*  Development*  TestingThis is just an example, your tasks should be more detailed.## Gantt ChartAssign concrete tasks to each team member and plan your time using a Gantt Chart.## Research state of the art projectsGo online and search for open source projects written in Python that do what your team want to do.Complete this table one row for each project. You should list at least one project for each team member (i.e. you should research at four different projects if your team has four team members)

You can also search for projects written in another language that you master.[This website can help you to edit Markdown tables](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#)
